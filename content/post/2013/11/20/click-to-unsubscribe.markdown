[Stop doing this crap on your startups website](http://harknesslabs.com/post/66570723467/stop-doing-this-crap-on-your-startups-website)

> 1: One click unsubscribe  
> Many sites butcher this process. You should have a link to 1-click unsubscribe at both the top and bottom of all emails you send. Don’t settle for “log in to unsubscribe” - Yes, its legal for transactional emails but its still stupid. You (the webmaster) will be the only one hurt when your user just marks you as spam instead because he doesn’t remember his password. If you want to ensure email deliver-ability for those who want your emails, there is zero benefit in hiding or making the unsubscribe difficult.
